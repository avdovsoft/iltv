## ILTV - data for IsraTV

This repo contains the channel manifest and other metadata for
my ([@quartern_roku](https://twitter.com/quartern_roku)) upcoming
private Roku app IsraTV.

The IsraTV app is super simple and just seeks to curate
most live streams for Israeli TV & Radio stations.

Whats not included?
===================
- This manifest includes only channels from Israel or channels in the 
  diaspora with Jewish focus.  (I do intend on adding an augmentation 
  feature to allow you to introduce a supplementary manifest to be 
  merged untop of this manifest at runtime (augmenting only your 
  experiance).
