## ILTV - data for IsraTV Roku app

This repo contains the channel manifest and other metadata for
my ([@quartern_roku](https://twitter.com/quartern_roku)) upcoming
private Roku app IsraTV.

The IsraTV app is super simple and just seeks to curate
most live streams for Israeli TV & Radio stations.

### Whats not included?
- This manifest includes only channels from Israel or channels originating
  in the diaspora with Jewish focus.   Note that I do intend on adding an
  augmentation feature to allow you to introduce a supplementary manifest
  to be merged unto of this manifest at runtime, augmenting only your 
  experiance.
- Hebrew in the app - to keep the app simple I am staying with predefined
  Roku screen formats which means no Hebrew characters.  I have yet to 
  experiment with utilizing external fonts with custom screen layouts.
  I expect this to be not simple (to me anyway).   Not to say that this
  will never happen, but I refuse to even look at it for the next 6 months.
- VOD - many of providers provide many of their titles on an on-demand basis.
  I'm not going to explore this till at least the prior bullet (Hebrew) has
  been resolved as the content metadata will surely contain Hebrew.
- Streams that I cant accesses & test.  This includes:
  + Streams that are geo-blocked (Russian language channel in Israel, #9 
    seems to be geo blocked)
  + Streams that are not nativly supported by Roku.  The details are 
   technical and I'm definitly [not versed in the details myself]
   (http://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/Video+Encoding+Guidelines#VideoEncodingGuidelines-LiveVideo).
   Usually if you can access the content on an Apple or Android mobile device
   it would probably be compatible.  This doe _NOT_ mean that you should send me apps, links to apps, etc.  I'm not 
   going to reverse engineer those.

  + Coordination of off-box
    transcoding is out of scope for this app and you may want to look into
    Kodi, Plex etc (Sorry can't help, I don't use those).
